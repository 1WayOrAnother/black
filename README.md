# The Fatal Lozenge, By Edward Gorey

An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.

The Lazar, blessed with an appearance
Enough to give the strongest qualms.
Has little need of perseverance
In prompting a display of alms.

The Zouave used to war and battle
Would sooner take a life than not:
It scarecly has begun to prattle
When he impales to hapless tot.
