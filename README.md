# The Fatal Lozenge, By Edward Gorey

An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.

The Drudge expends her life in mopping, In emptying and filling pails;
And she will do so, never stopping, Until her strength entirely fails.

The Invalid wakes up in terror To feel his toes becoming numb;
The doctor's made another error- What unkown symptoms are to come?
