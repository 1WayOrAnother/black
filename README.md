# The Fatal Lozenge, By Edward Gorey

An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.

The Cad decides he has grown weary Of this affair, and that is that;
And so he tells her just dreary He thinks she is, then leaves the flat.

The Effigy, got up with clothing Abstracted from the victim's room,
Is raised aloft to cheers of loathing Before it meets a flaming doom.

The Fetishist gets out the hassock, Turns down the lamp, and blots the door;
Then in galoshes and a cassock, He worshipss It upon the floor.

The Proctor buys a pupil ices, And hopes the boy will not resist
When he attempts to practise vices Few people even know exist.
